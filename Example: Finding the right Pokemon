-- based on the incredible pokemon dataset provided here: https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/26b9357c6120d3d0d27c2b90c950e8c6
-- EXAMPLE: my friend is building a new competitive pokemon team. they're stuck on who their final pokemon should be and have asked me to provide some options. 
-- they need a pokemon who has a high health and defensive stat, and the types that would best fit their team are dragon, fairy, or ghost type pokemon. 
-- they started playing pokemon with generation 4, so they would like a pokemon who was introduced in gen 4 or later so they could be the most familiar. 
-- to top it off, they have a preference for legendary pokemon because they don't have any other legendaries on their team so far. 
-- here is a query i ran to meet all of that criteria.

select 
name, 
Type_1, 
Type_2,
generation,
    case
        when type_1="Dragon" then "yes"
        when type_2="Dragon" then "yes"
        when type_1="Fairy" then "yes"
        when type_2="Fairy" then "yes"
        when type_1="Ghost" then "yes"
        when type_2="Ghost" then "yes"
        else "no"
    end as "specified type?",
round((hp+defense)/2) as health_ranking
from pokemon
where legendary like "true" and "specified type?"="yes" and health_ranking >100
group by name
having generation >= 4
order by health_ranking desc;
